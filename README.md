# Kusuo Discord bot
Kusuo is a Discord bot that I use for setting up premium servers for my other bot *Anime Releases*. Feel free to join the community Discord server for my bot at discord.gg/M4e6dcw7Cf. I will only update this bot when something doesn't work anymore, and that's not even going to guarentee an update, so when something breaks, don't come back here whining. Feel free to use the code from this project with your own project without worrying about copyright issues, I honestly don't care.

# Requirements
* Python 3.7 or above
* Discord.py 1.5 or above

You might be able to lower then these requirements, but the code might not work as intended

# Please Read
Please don't try to learn python or take much from this project. This is beginner knowledge because I'm not touching cogs, sharding or anything else semi-advanced.
